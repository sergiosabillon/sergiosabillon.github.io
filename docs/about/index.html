    <p>Sergio Sabillon is a violinist, arranger and educator born and raised in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. A son of educators, Sergio started his music education at the age of 6 years old and continued his formation at the Victoriano Lopez Music School. During his last year there, he was selected along with an elusive group of musicians to perform at Pittsburg State University in Kansas.</p>
<p>After music school, Sergio enrolled in college as a civil engineering student, but he couldn’t let go of his passion for music. He was chosen to tour with the Central American and Caribbean Youth Orchestra (OJCA) in Mexico and Germany. More than just a chance to perform, this experience allowed him to continue applying his talent with the violin. After, he spent 2017 with the Philarmonic Orchestra of Honduras, traveling to and from Tegucigalpa to continue his love of music. It was here at the end of this journey, Sergio decided he will pursue music as a permanent career.</p>
<p>In 2021, after winning Third Place in the International Orchestra Audition Awards in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/samniumuniversity/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samnium University of Music</a> in Italy, Sergio moved to the United States to study music performance at Valdosta State University (VSU), Georgia with the distinguished violinist <a href="https://www.valdosta.edu/about/directory/profile/kpyu"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Kristin Pfeifer</a>, mentored by <a href="http://www.liquidclay.com/com/chapo.htm"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eliot Chapo</a>. Since his move to the US from Honduras, Sergio has participated yearly as teaching assistant and as a conductor in the <a href="https://southgeorgiastrings.com/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Georgia String Project</a>. He has also received honors such as participating in the VSU Honors Recital.</p>
<p>Sergio has been a member of numerous orchestras and ensembles such as The National Philarmonic Orchestra Of Honduras, The Central American and Caribbean Youth Orchestra (OJCA), The Orchestra of the Americas, Southeast Kansas Symphony, Albany Symphony Orchestra, The Grand Rapid Symphony Orchestra, Blue Lake Public Radio in Michigan, The VSU opera and The VSU String Ensemble. He currently plays at the Valdosta Symphony Orchestra under <a href="https://www.valdosta.edu/about/directory/profile/hphsu"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Howard Hsu</a>. Sergio has also performed with distinguished artists such as Maria Ioudenitch, Geneva Lewis, Isar Quartet Munich Philarmonic, Melissa White, Natasha Paremski, John Nakamatsu, Kelly Hall-Tompkins, Byron Stripling, Carmen Bradford, and Igor Kalni.</p>
<p>Sergio is passionate about connecting different cultures through music and inspiring individuals to engage in it. Because of this, Sergio has taken on leadership roles such as teaching and mentoring to young upcoming musicians, such as taking the role of camp counselor at the <a href="https://bluelake.org/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp</a>. Sergio moved to the United States because he knew the lack of opportunities for musicians in Honduras would make it challenging to do that as a career. Because of this, today he is willing to encourage students who wish to fulfill their dreams the same way that he has and help them along the way.</p>
